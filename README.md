# RedditResponder
A Chat Bot-style program that draws from Reddit to engage with the user in a non-task-oriented conversation

This project draws from/is a component of the TickTock project
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/zhouyu/www/TickTock.pdf). However,
the TickTock project requires a full Kinect-based setup for spoken
interaction, and draws from a database. This component, in contrast,
only uses text-based components to simplify use, and queries Reddit
directly to find an appropriate response to user input.

To run the program, in the command line, run:

    python StartConversation.py


Dependencies
------------
Requires praw and pyasn1. Assuming python is installed, these can be
installed using

	pip install praw
	pip install pyasn1
